## Programming Challenge

This script is meant to complete the programming challenge sent to me 
prior consideration for the Python Backend Developer position I have applied to.

Per it's requirements, I decided to complete it as a CLI, using Typer as foundation software.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this application, you will need to have Python 3 installed in your
local system.

### Installation

To install the dependencies needed to run this application, execute the following on a command line terminal:

```
pip install -r dependencies.pip
```

### Functionality

For usage information, such as command line arguments, execute the following on a command line terminal: 
```
python parsefile.py --help
```
Input data is stored in the input.dat file. This can be modified for further testing.

To run the script given the input file values are as desired, execute the following on a command line terminal:

```
python parsefile.py input.dat
```

### Tests

In order to run the automated test, execute the following in a command terminal:

```
pytest 
```
